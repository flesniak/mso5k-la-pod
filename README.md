# WTF?

This is a reimplementation of the Logic Analyzer pod for the MSO5k scopes.

The schematic and PCB is in kicad 5 format.


# Current status / TODO

* I belive the schematic pretty closely matches the original pod.
* I have not yet laid out a PCB.

# PCB

The plan is to lay out a 2 layer PCB and accept that it will take up more space


# Idea: Split pod into two 8-input podlets

I have been considering splitting the 16-input pod into two 8 port podlets in stead, that would give some advantages:

* The cables to the scope would be more flexible.
* It would be easier to probe in two points.
* If only one pod is needed, then it doesn't need to take up space on the table.
