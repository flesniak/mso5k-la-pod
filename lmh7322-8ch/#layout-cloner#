#Script for KiCAD Pcbnew to clone a part of a layout. The scipt clones a row or a matrce
#of similar layouts.
#
#For now, there are no command line parameters given for the script, instead
#all the settings are written in this file. Before using this script, you must have your schema
#ready.
#1. Use hierarchical sheets for the subschemas to be cloned and annotate them 
#so that each sheet has module references starting with a different hundred.
#2. Import a netlist into Pcbnew and place all the components except the ones to be cloned.
#3. In the same board file, create also an optimal layout for the subschema to be used
#as the template for the clones.
#4. Surround the layout of the subchema with a zone in the comment layer.
#5. Save the .kicad_pcb file and run this script.
#
#The script has three main parts:
#First, the script moves the modules, which are already imported into the board file. They are
#moved by a predetermined offset amount compared to the template module. (A module with the same
#reference, except starting with a different hundred, eg. templatemodule = D201, clones = D301, D401, D501 etc.)
#Second, the script clones the zones inside the comment layer zone. It seems the zone to be cloned must
#be completely inside the comment zone. Zones have a net defined for them. The script searches for any
#pads inside the cloned zone and sets their net for the zone. So you may get a wrong zone for the net if
#there are pads with different nets inside the zone.
#Third, the script clones the tracks inside the comment zone. Any track touching the zone will be cloned.
#Tracks do not have nets defined for them so they should connect nicely to the modules they will be touching
#after the cloning process.
#
#This script has been tested with KiCAD version BZR 5382 with all scripting settings turned on. (Ubuntu and Python 2.7.6)
#The script can be run in Linux terminal with command $python pcbnew_cloner.py
